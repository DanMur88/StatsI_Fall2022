### Part 1 ###

# Create an object for IQ of the random sample of 25 students.

IQ <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 
        113, 112, 98, 80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)

# Plot distribution of the sample data

plot(density(IQ), main = "Density Plot of Student IQ Sample")

# Calculate number of observations and mean 

n_IQ <- length(IQ)

mean_IQ <- sum(IQ)/length(IQ)

# Calculate standard deviation and save as object

sq_diff <- vector("double", length = length(IQ))

for (i in seq_len(length(IQ))) {
  sq_diff[i] <- (IQ[i]-mean_IQ)^2
}

sd_IQ <- sqrt((sum(sq_diff))/(n_IQ - 1))

#Calculate standard error and save as object
se_IQ <- sd_IQ / sqrt(n_IQ)

# Construct a 90% confidence interval for the average IQ of the 
# population of all students in the school using a t-distribution, as
# the sample size n is relatively small and the exact standard error
# of the population is unknown. We need to substitute the sample standard deviation "s" 
# for the population standard deviation to get the estimated standard
# error, which introduces extra error and necessitates replacing the
# z-score with a t-score.
#
# Begin by finding the relevant t-score for a 90% confidence 
# interval with df = 24 (n-1), making the assumption that the 
# sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal. 
# Input this value as an object.

tscore_IQ <- qt(0.95, 24, lower.tail = TRUE)

# Calculate the margin of error and record it as an object.

MOE <- tscore_IQ * se_IQ

# Construct our 90% confidence interval by subtracting the 
# margin of error from our point estimator (sample mean) to 
# establish its lower bound, and adding the margin of error to our
# point estimator (sample mean) to establish its upper bound.

CI_lower <- mean_IQ - MOE
CI_upper <- mean_IQ + MOE

### Part 2 ###

# Test for the null hypothesis that mean_IQ = 100, with the
# alternative hypothesis being mean_IQ > 100.

# Calculate the value of the test statistic.

tscore_null <- ((mean_IQ - 100))/se_IQ

# As we are testing the probability that the average IQ of students 
# in our sample is higher than the average IQ score, i.e. P[Xâ‰¤x], 
# we find the right-tailed P-score for our test statistic, the 
# t-score -0.59574, with degrees of freedom df = 24.

p_value <- pt(abs(tscore_null), n_IQ-1, lower.tail = T)

# The right-tailed P-value is 0.72. Therefore we do not reject the null 
# hypothesis at a 0.05 significance level.
